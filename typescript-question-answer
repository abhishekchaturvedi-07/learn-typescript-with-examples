-How many default exports can a module have?
-1

-Okay, consider we have a file named "./module.ts". Below question are based on this file:

- export const A = 'A'
  export const B = 'B'
  How would you import A into your code?
- To import it, use import {A} from './module'

- const A = 'A'
  const getA = () => A
  export default getA
  How would you import the function "getA" into your module?
- import getA from './module'

- const A = 'A'
  const B = 'B'
  const AB = A + B
  How would you import A and B into your module?
- We cant import which we didnt export using the export keyword. In this question, that is not a module, because it doesn't export anything.
